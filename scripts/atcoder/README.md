# AtCoder scripts

These scripts are forked from the `putnamlike*` scripts described in the general README

See https://github.com/jettjaniak/chainscope/compare/tmp-arthur-atcoder-parsing?expand=1 for some of the example files created by the scripts (there should also be more committed anyway.

Note you need the custom AtCoder Tools repo here: https://github.com/arthurdupe/atcoder-tools (which is specified in the `pyproject.toml` file), and to set some ATCODER... environment variables.

Note: `chainscope/data/cot_responses/instr-v0/default_sampling_params/atcoder/... ` is in the `.gitignore` file, so it is not saved by default (to not pollute the repo).
