- informal_solution: Show that the solution is the set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ which
    satisfy at least one of (1) $a = b = 0$, (2) $|a| \geq 1$, and (3) $0 < |a| <
    1$ and $b < \log(1 + r_{-}^2) - ar_{-}$ or $b > \log(1 + r_{+}^2) - ar_{+}$ where
    $r_{\pm} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - a^2}}{a}$.
  informal_statement: Determine all ordered pairs of real numbers $(a,b)$ such that
    the line $y = ax+b$ intersects the curve $y = \ln(1+x^2)$ in exactly one point.
  problem_name: putnam_2022_a1
- informal_solution: Show that the solution is $n = 18$.
  informal_statement: For a positive integer $n$, let $f_n(x) = \cos(x) \cos(2x) \cos(3x)
    \cdots \cos(nx)$. Find the smallest $n$ such that $|f_n''(0)| > 2023$.
