**Problem**:
For what integer $a$ does $x^2-x+a$ divide $x^{13}+x+90$?

**Model's final answer**:
["To solve this problem, I need to find the value of $a$ for which $x^2 - x + a$ divides $x^{13} + x + 90$.\n\nIf a polynomial $g(x)$ divides another polynomial $f(x)$, then every root of $g(x)$ must also be a root of $f(x)$.\n\nLet's say the roots of $x^2 - x + a$ are $r$ and $s$. Then:\n- $r + s = 1$ (coefficient of $x$)\n- $rs = a$ (constant term)\n\nFor these roots to be roots of $x^{13} + x + 90$, we need:\n$r^{13} + r + 90 = 0$ and $s^{13} + s + 90 = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we get:\n$r^{13} = -r - 90$ and $s^{13} = -s - 90$\n\nAdding these two equations:\n$r^{13} + s^{13} = -(r + s) - 180 = -1 - 180 = -181$\n\nNow I need to express $r^{13} + s^{13}$ in terms of $a$.\n\nI'll use the recurrence relation for the sum of powers of roots. If $p_n = r^n + s^n$, then:\n$p_0 = 2$\n$p_1 = 1$\n$p_n = p_1 \\cdot p_{n-1} - a \\cdot p_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 2$\n\nComputing successive values:\n$p_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 - a \\cdot 2 = 1 - 2a$\n$p_3 = 1 \\cdot (1 - 2a) - a \\cdot 1 = 1 - 3a$\n$p_4 = 1 \\cdot (1 - 3a) - a \\cdot (1 - 2a) = 1 - 4a + 2a^2$\n\nContinuing this process all the way to $p_{13}$, I get:\n$p_{13} = 1 - 13a + 65a^2 - 156a^3 + 182a^4 - 91a^5 + 13a^6$\n\nSince $p_{13} = -181$, I have:\n$1 - 13a + 65a^2 - 156a^3 + 182a^4 - 91a^5 + 13a^6 = -181$\n\nRearranging:\n$13a^6 - 91a^5 + 182a^4 - 156a^3 + 65a^2 - 13a + 182 = 0$\n\nTesting $a = 2$:\n$13(2^6) - 91(2^5) + 182(2"]

**Problem**:
Let $x : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a twice differentiable function whose second derivative is nonstrictly decreasing. If $x(t) - x(0) = s$, $x'(0) = 0$, and $x'(t) = v$ for some $t > 0$, find the maximum possible value of $t$ in terms of $s$ and $v$.

**Model's final answer**:
['# Finding the Maximum Possible Value of t\n\nI\'ll solve this step-by-step by analyzing the constraints and finding when t is maximized.\n\n## Given information:\n- $x: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is twice differentiable\n- Second derivative $x\'\'$ is nonstrictly decreasing\n- $x(t) - x(0) = s$\n- $x\'(0) = 0$\n- $x\'(t) = v$ for some $t > 0$\n\n## Step 1: Express the constraints mathematically\nFrom $x(t) - x(0) = s$, we have:\n$s = \\int_0^t x\'(\\tau) d\\tau$\n\nThis is the area under the velocity curve $x\'(\\tau)$ from 0 to t.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the behavior of $x\'(\\tau)$\nWe know that $x\'\'(\\tau)$ is nonstrictly decreasing. This means the rate of increase of $x\'(\\tau)$ is highest at the beginning and decreases (or stays constant) as $\\tau$ increases.\n\nGiven that $x\'(0) = 0$ and $x\'(t) = v$, we need to find how $x\'(\\tau)$ increases from 0 to v to maximize t.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the optimal function\nTo maximize t, we want to minimize the average value of $x\'(\\tau)$ over $[0,t]$. This happens when $x\'(\\tau)$ increases as slowly as possible from 0 to v.\n\nSince $x\'\'(\\tau)$ is nonstrictly decreasing, the "slowest" way for $x\'(\\tau)$ to increase is when $x\'\'(\\tau)$ is constant. In this case, $x\'(\\tau)$ increases linearly from 0 to v.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum value of t\nIf $x\'\'(\\tau) = a$ (constant), then:\n- $x\'(\\tau) = a\\tau$ (since $x\'(0) = 0$)\n- At $\\tau = t$: $v = at$, so $a = \\frac{v}{t}$\n- $s = \\int_0^t x\'(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^t a\\tau d\\tau = a\\frac{t^2}{2} = \\frac{v}{t} \\cdot \\frac{t^2}{2} = \\frac{vt}{2}$\n\nSolving for t:\n$t = \\frac{2s}{v}$\n\n## Step 5: Verify this is the maximum\nAny other function with nonstrictly decreasing second derivative would make $x\'(\\tau)$ increase faster at the beginning and slower at the end. This would result in a larger average value of $x\'(\\tau)$, requiring a smaller t to achieve the same area s.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of t in terms of s and v is:\n$$t = \\frac{2s}{v}$$']

Show that the maximum possible time is $t = \frac{2s}{v}$.

**Problem**:
Given real numbers $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_i\}$, ($i=1,2,3,4$), such that $a_1b_2-a_2b_1 \neq 0$. Consider the set of all solutions $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ of the simultaneous equations $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+a_4x_4=0$ and $b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_3+b_4x_4=0$, for which no $x_i$ ($i=1,2,3,4$) is zero. Each such solution generates a $4$-tuple of plus and minus signs $(\text{signum }x_1,\text{signum }x_2,\text{signum }x_3,\text{signum }x_4)$. Determine, with a proof, the maximum number of distinct $4$-tuples possible.

**Model's final answer**:
["Looking at this math problem, I need to determine the maximum number of distinct sign 4-tuples that can be generated by solutions to a system of two linear equations.\n\nLet me analyze this step by step:\n\nFirst, I understand that we have:\n- Two linear equations: $a_i x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 + a_4 x_4 = 0$ and $b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + b_3 x_3 + b_4 x_4 = 0$\n- We're considering solutions where none of the $x_i$ values are zero\n- For each solution, we look at the sign pattern $(sign(x_1), sign(x_2), sign(x_3), sign(x_4))$\n- We need the maximum number of distinct sign patterns possible\n\nThe key insight is that these two equations define a 2-dimensional subspace in 4-dimensional space (assuming the equations are linearly independent). This subspace can intersect with the different orthants (regions where the variables have specific sign combinations) of the 4D space.\n\nFor a $d$-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the maximum number of sign patterns is given by the formula:\n$2 \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\binom{n-1}{i}$\n\nIn our case, $d = 2$ and $n = 4$, so the maximum number is:\n$2 \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\binom{3}{i} = 2(\\binom{3}{0} + \\binom{3}{1}) = 2(1 + 3) = 8$\n\nI can verify this is tight by constructing an example. Consider a solution space spanned by vectors $(1, 1, 0, -1)$ and $(1, -1, 1, 0)$. Any solution has the form $(s+t, s-t, t, -s)$ for scalars $s$ and $t$. By analyzing the different combinations of signs for $s$ and $t$ and their relative magnitudes, we can show exactly 8 distinct sign patterns are achievable.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of distinct 4-tuples possible is 8."]

Show that the maximum number of distinct $4$-tuples is eight.
